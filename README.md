# The Modern C++ Challenge
This repository is for source codes I'm writing while studying the book [The Modern C++ Challenge](https://www.packtpub.com/product/the-modern-c-challenge/9781788993869).
Although I'm writing the codes with my own hands but the original source code can be found at the [github repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Modern-Cpp-Challenge).
